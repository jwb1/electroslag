# electroslag

This project has been archived. For some years, it was my side project, though the world evolved faster than the code did. On top of that , there are a number of fairly critical design errors. For starters, the binary data format is both too brittle and does not support seeking to objects. The decision to modularize is helpful for testing, but not extending all the way the content cooking in the same program. See the TODO as well for more problems.
